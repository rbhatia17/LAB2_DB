Reduced the data to the columns that were needed.
Changed the year from its values to the actual year.
Errors :
I changed the sensitivity from its values to the actual data.
I removed the rows that had year value as null.


Next time i do this i am going to analyze my data all over again and this time i do it i will do it in the manner you taught in the class today that is first think who is my audience, what are the tasks i need to do that is goals, questions and the metrics. Then go with my road map. I think if i do the same visualization again i will come up with something different and more relevant to the claim.
